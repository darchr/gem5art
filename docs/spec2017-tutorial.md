# Tutorial: Run SPEC CPU 2017 Benchmarks in Full System Mode with gem5art  

## Introduction  
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to utilize gem5art to run SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks in gem5 full system mode. 
The full example with all of the gem5art tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/darchr/gem5art-experiments). 
The scripts in this tutorial work with gem5art-* v0.3.1.  

**Note**: This steps in this tutorial are mostly identical to that of [the SPEC 2006 tutorial](spec2006-tutorial.md). 
The differences are in the scripts used to create the disk image, and the name of the benchmarks.  


### SPEC CPU 2017 Benchmarks
